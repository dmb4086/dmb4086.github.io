      I'm currently a 4th year student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.rit.edu/" target="_blank">Rochester Institue of Technology</a> and 
      I have been building web applications for 3+ years now

      <!-- majoring in Web & Mobile computing. I recently graduated from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>
      after completing three awesome six-month co-ops at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/" target="_blank">MullenLowe U.S.</a>,
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>, and
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a>. -->

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical
      knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are
      scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

        Barcelona game
        or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
